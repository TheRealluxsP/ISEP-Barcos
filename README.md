This project is a simple boat management database, developed as part of the Databases and Data Warehouses course at LETI - ISEP.

It was created in a team of three with the goal of learning how to design and implement a relational database using SQL Server.

ðŸ’¡ Note: The project was originally hosted on a university account. After completion, it was migrated to this personal repository â€” hence the single commit history.
